# Blockchain Systems Engineering Journey

A hands-on implementation of blockchain fundamentals and advanced systems engineering concepts in Rust.

## 🎯 Goal
To understand blockchain not just as "smart contracts" but as distributed systems engineering:
- Cryptographic primitives
- Consensus mechanisms  
- Execution environments (EVM, Sealevel, Wasm)
- Node engineering & networking

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Rust (primary)
- **Blockchains:** Substrate (Polkadot SDK) & Solana
- **Focus:** Systems engineering over basic DApp development

## 📚 Learning Path
Following a structured curriculum from cryptographic foundations to parachain/validator development.

## 🚀 Progress
- [x] Cryptographic primitives (SHA-256, Merkle Trees, Ed25519)
- [ ] Consensus mechanisms (PoW, PoS, PoH)
- [ ] Substrate FRAME development
- [ ] Solana Sealevel programs
- [ ] Cross-chain & advanced topics
